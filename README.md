# Fractol

Fractol - Making pretty fractals

The objective of this project was to explore fractals and generate them graphically. Here is a breakdown of its features: 

- 5 fractals: Julia, Mandelbrot, Burning Ship, Sierpinsky Carpet and my own.
- Movng the mouse around over the Julia fractal udpates one of parameters of the equation and updates it visually.
- Zoom and unzoom on mouse.
- You can zoom in an infinite way, until, of course, the limitations of the CPU are met. 
- There are a varity of color palettes available.
- Multiple fractals can be opened at the same time.
- An instruction window is available.
